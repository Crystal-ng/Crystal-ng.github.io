## About Me 

My name is Crystal Ng. I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan working at the Institute for Social Reserach and the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation. I obtained a Ph.D. in Human Development and Family Sciences with specializations in [Aging & Health](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/talc/students/portfolio-in-aging-and-health/index.php) and [Applied Statistical Modeling](https://stat.utexas.edu/graduate/portfolio-in-applied-statistical-modeling) from the University of Texas at Austin in August 2022. Currently, I'm conducting social and clincal researach to better understand how social factors (including but not limited to relationships with spouses, friends, siblings, neighbors) shape health or well-being for different populations (e.g., caregivers, racial minority groups, clinical populations such as people with dementia, people with physical disability). My research work utilizes mobile and wearable technologies to track individual‚Äôs moment-to-moment activities, symptoms, and functioning in real-life settings. In my leisure time, I enjoy assembling furniture, reading books and news, and trying new recipes. I also enjoy immersing myself into the nature through walking with my family dog [Shakespe](https://www.facebook.com/ShakespeTheCorgi), hiking, biking, and paddle boarding.
