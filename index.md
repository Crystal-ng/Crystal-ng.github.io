## About Me 

My name is Crystal Ng. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. I will complete my dissertation and receive a Ph.D. in Human Development and Family Sciences with a [Portfolio in Aging & Health](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/talc/students/portfolio-in-aging-and-health/index.php) and [Applied Statistical Modeling](https://stat.utexas.edu/graduate/portfolio-in-applied-statistical-modeling) from the University of Texas at Austin in August 2022. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books and news and trying new recipes. I also enjoy immersing myself into the nature through walking with my family dog [Shakespe](https://www.facebook.com/ShakespeTheCorgi), hiking, mountain or road biking, and paddle boarding.
